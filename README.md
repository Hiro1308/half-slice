# Half-Slice
A local FFMPEG based MP4 video slicer with a Half-Life theme

### Instalation:

To fully run this program locally, we have to install FFMPEG in this directory. You can find FFMPEG here:
https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

We just have to drop the .exe files in ffmpeg/bin.

For the moment, this program only works with MP4 files.

### Libraries used:
- Tkinter: Used for the GUI
- MoviePY: For the video preview display and different stuff
- FFmpeg: To encode, slice and process new video clips
- Pillow: Used for images
- Pygame: To handle sound effects
- OS, sys, json, time, threading and subprocess: In order to work with user interaction and generic functionalities 

This is an alpha version, there are a lot of things that need to be fixed and code to be optimized :)
